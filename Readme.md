# Golang Simple Rest Microservice with Docker

Just a small example/boilerplate code so I can quickly clone it and play arround.

Using docker-compose for EZ life
Using Gorilla's Mux

## Install

Just clone and:

- Copy `.env.template` to `.env` (check contents too)

- Build / bring it up with:
```
   $ docker-compose up
```

- Open: `http://localhost/` (by default)

## Licence
GPL ftw

Also, who cares?, Feel free to Fork it or whatever, but don't expect much activity here. I'm just starting to play with Go.
